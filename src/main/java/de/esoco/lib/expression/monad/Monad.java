	 * Therefore this type of method is sometimes also called "lift" or
	 * "liftM2".

	 * but they can simply invoke the default implementation (<code>
	 * Monad.super.and(rOther, fJoin)</code>) and cast the result to their own
	 * type. The explicit declaration in subclasses is necessary because of the
	 * limitations of Java's generic type system.</p>
