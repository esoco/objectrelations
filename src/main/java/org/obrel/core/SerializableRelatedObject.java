/**
 * A related object subclass that implements the {@link Serializable} interface
 * so that it can be serialized to a stream. Applications that need serializable
 * related objects should use or extend this class.
 *
 * <p>When serializing a related object all of it's relations will be serialized
 * (with the exception of transient relations that have a type with the modifier
 * {@link RelationTypeModifier#TRANSIENT} set). This means that all target
 * objects of these relations must be serializable too, or else an exception
 * will be thrown.</p>
 *
 * <p>If target objects are (serializable) related objects or if relations are
 * set on the relations, these sub-relations will be serialized too. Trying to
 * serialize very complex relation structures may result in large serialization
 * output or even cause stack overflow errors. Therefore it is necessary to
 * monitor the complexity of the objects to be serialized and to use transient
 * relation types if necessary.</p>
