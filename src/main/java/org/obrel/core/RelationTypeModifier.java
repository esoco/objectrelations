/********************************************************************
 * An enumeration of modifiers that define certain static aspects of relation
 * types. The following modifiers are currently available:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #FINAL}: relations with a final modifier cannot be modified or
 *     deleted after they have been created. If the relation type provides an
 *     initial value the final relation will also be created on the first access
 *     to the relation target with the {@link Relatable#get(RelationType)}
 *     method. To avoid this automatic creation an application must either set
 *     the relation first with {@link Relatable#set(RelationType, Object)} or
 *     provide an initial value of NULL for the relation type.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #READONLY}: other than final ones relation types with a readonly
 *     modifier cannot be modified at all, even when they are created (i.e. they
 *     cannot be set with an initial value). Such a type must always return a
 *     value from it's {@link RelationType#initialValue(Relatable)} method
 *     because otherwise the value of relations with that type would always be
 *     NULL. The readonly modifier is typically used for relation types that
 *     generate their target value automatically, e.g. by calculating them from
 *     other relations or by performing a lookup on some kind of resource.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #TRANSIENT}: relations with a transient modifier will be ignored
 *     during the serialization of a {@link SerializableRelatedObject}.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #PRIVATE}: relations with a private modifier will not be visible
 *     in predicate-based relation queries or to relation listeners. They can
 *     only be accessed by methods that use an explicit relation type argument.
 *     Therefore only code to which the type constant is accessible will have
 *     access to the relations with a private type. This modifier can also be
 *     used to prevent write access to certain relations: by internally using a
 *     writable relation type that is non-public and another public type as a
 *     view with {@link Relation#viewAs(RelationType, RelatedObject)} (because
 *     views are always readonly).</li>
 * </ul>
