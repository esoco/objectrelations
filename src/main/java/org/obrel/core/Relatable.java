/**
 * This interface defines the public methods that are provided by related
 * objects. It's main purpose is to be used as a base interface for other
 * interfaces, so that implementations of such interfaces can be used as related
 * objects without casting to {@link RelatedObject}. But implementations cannot
 * implement the methods of this interface by themselves. Instead, they must
 * inherit the implementation by extending the base class {@link RelatedObject}
 * because this base class contains additional management methods.
 *
 * <p>If subclassing {@link RelatedObject} is not possible this interface must
 * not be used. The handling of object relations should then be done through the
 * corresponding methods of the {@link ObjectRelations} class which can be
 * applied to arbitrary objects.</p>
 *
 * <p>Application code that needs to check for relation handling capability of
 * objects with the instanceof operator should do so by checking against this
 * interface (and not {@link RelatedObject}). That will make the code compatible
 * with possible future extensions which could provide other implementations of
 * this interface.</p>
 *
 * <p>All methods in this interface that expect a predicate parameter will only
 * work on public relations, i.e. relations with a type that doesn't have the
 * relation type modifier {@link RelationTypeModifier#PRIVATE} set.</p>
