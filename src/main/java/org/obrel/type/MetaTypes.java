/********************************************************************
 * This class contains definitions of standard meta-relation types. Relations
 * with meta-types contain information about the objects they are set on. These
 * objects are often other relations which are annotated with meta relations to
 * further define their structure or behavior. For example, a meta-relation with
 * the type {@link #MODIFIED} indicates whether a certain object (e.g. a
 * relation) has been modified or not. How such a relation is set depends on the
 * respective application although some of the standard types are already
 * supported by the object relations framework.
 *
 * <p>It is recommended that applications use the standard types defined in this
 * class if applicable to increase the interoperability of relation-based code
 * because using standard types allows library code and tools to access and
 * display such relations in a standard way.</p>
