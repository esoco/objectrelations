# The ObjectRelations project

This project contains the ObjectRelations library. ObjectRelations is a new development concept that is can be seen as an extension and enhancement of object-oriented software development. The main idea behind it is to model the relations between objects similar to the way object-orientation models the elements of a software development project. The ObjectRelations project also contains a framework for functional programming that is used throughout all dependent frameworks. It is recommended to study the ObjectRelations documentation before other frameworks that are based on it to get an understanding of the underlying principles.
