This project contains the ObjectRelations framework. ObjectRelations is a new development concept that can be seen as an extension and enhancement of object-oriented software development. The main idea behind it is to model the relations between  objects similar to the way the objects themselves are modeled in object-orientation. It is recommended to study the ObjectRelations documentation before other [SDACK](https://github.com/esoco/sdack) frameworks that are built upon it to get an understanding of the underlying principles.

The project documentation can be found in the [SDACK documentation project](https://github.com/esoco/sdack-docs). The documentation is also [available on Gitbooks](https://esoco.gitbook.io/sdack/frameworks/objectrelations).
